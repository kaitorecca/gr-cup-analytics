# What to Build
Your mission is to use the provided race Datasets in folder "barber" to develop a project that provides novel insights or tools. Your project can be anything from a software application, to a predictive model, or an in-depth analytical report, or even an interactive dashboard or anything else you can think of.

Choose one of the following categories to compete in:

Driver Training & Insights: Create a tool or analysis that could help a driver identify areas for improvement, optimize their racing line, or better understand their performance.
Pre-Event Prediction: Can you predict the future? Develop a model to forecast qualifying results, race pace, tire degradation, or other key performance indicators before the green flag drops.
Post-Event Analysis: Go beyond the final standings. Create a dashboard or report that tells the story of the race, revealing key moments and strategic decisions that led to the outcome.
Real-Time Analytics: Design a tool that simulates real-time decision-making for a race engineer. What's the perfect pit stop window? How can you react to a caution flag?
Wildcard: Have a brilliant idea that doesn’t fit the categories above? Surprise us! This category is for the most creative and out-of-the-box applications of racing data.
We’re looking to develop a real-time analytics and strategy tool for the GR Cup Series that will help enhance driver insights, team performance, and race-day decision-making.

# Judging criteria

## Application of the TRD Datasets
Does the project apply the datasets in an effective way, fitting with the categories? Does the project showcase the datasets uniquely?
## Design
Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out? Is there a balanced blend of frontend and backend in the software?
## Potential Impact:
How big of an impact could the project have on the Toyota Racing community? How big of an impact could it have beyond the target community?
## Quality of the Idea
How creative and unique is the project? Does the concept exist already? If so, how much does the project improve on it?
